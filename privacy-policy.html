                    <strong>Build Creativity</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Tap Circle mobile application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

                <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
                <p>Our game is designed to be simple and we do not directly collect any personally identifiable information from you. However, our third-party service providers may collect data to ensure the functionality of the game and to serve advertisements.</p>

                <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mt-4">Usage Data & Device Information</h4>
                <p>
                    Our advertising partner (Google AdMob) may collect information on how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), device type, operating system version, and other diagnostic data.
                </p>

                <h4 class="text-md font-semibold mt-4">Tracking & Advertising IDs</h4>
                 <p>
                    Our partner uses technologies like device identifiers or advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID) to serve advertisements. For users under the age of consent, this information is used for limited purposes such as frequency capping (to not show the same ad too many times), contextual advertising (ads based on the app's content), and to combat fraud and abuse.

                <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
                <p>Data collected by our partners is used for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To provide and maintain our Service (e.g., by showing ads to keep it free)</li>
                    <li>To monitor the usage of our Service</li>
                    <li>To detect, prevent and address technical issues</li>
                    <li>To provide advertisements</li>

                <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
                <p>
                    We employ third-party companies to facilitate our Service. The only third-party service we use is for advertising.
                </p>

                        <strong>Google AdMob:</strong> This service is used to display advertisements within the app, which helps keep the game free.

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Our Service is intended for a general audience that includes children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your country) ourselves.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    Our advertising partner, Google AdMob, is responsible for collecting data through their SDK. We have configured our ad settings to indicate that our app is directed at children. This is intended to disable interest-based advertising and data collection for that purpose for users under the age of consent. The data collected by AdMob is used for limited purposes like serving contextual ads and for other functions that support the internal operations of the Service.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                    If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us immediately at our support email. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information.
                </p>

It is your responsibility to review the privacy policies of any third-party services.</p>
